## Introduction

This repository contains five key APIs designed to handle user-related operations, file management, and cookie management. The APIs are straightforward to use and are built with a focus on performance and security.

## APIs Overview

Here are the APIs included in this repository:

1. **User Registration**: `POST /user/register`
   - This endpoint allows new users to register by providing necessary details like username and password. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt.

2. **User File Upload**: `POST /user/file`
   - Users can upload files to the server. This API handles file uploads efficiently and securely.

3. **Dynamic Parameter Handling**: `GET /user/param/:param`
   - This endpoint retrieves data based on a dynamic parameter. It allows for flexible queries.

4. **Cookie Management**: `GET /user/cookie`
   - This API retrieves cookies set in the user's browser. It helps in managing user sessions.

5. **Set Cookie**: `POST /user/set-cookie`
   - This endpoint allows the server to set cookies in the user's browser. It's essential for session management.

For detailed information about each API, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/Tahsan203438/set-cookie--get-cookie--apis/releases) section.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tahsan203438/set-cookie--get-cookie--apis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd set-cookie--get-cookie--apis
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file**:
   - You will need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
     ```

5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using the APIs. Here‚Äôs a brief guide on how to use each API.

  "password": "your_password"
}
```

### User File Upload
